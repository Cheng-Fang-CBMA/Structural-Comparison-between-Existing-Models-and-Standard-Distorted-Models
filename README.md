# Structural-Comparison-between-Existing-Models-and-Standard-Distorted-Models
       Each folder is named according to the classification shown in Tab. 3 and 4 of the article (Part II).
In each folder, the cif file is identified by its ICSD collection code. The corresponding standard distorted 
model before relaxation is POSCAR.cif, and the corresponding standard distorted model after relaxation 
is CONTCAR.cif. The structural comparison is performed using Pymatgen (see matcher.py), and the result 
is provided in output.txt.
       All the tungsten oxide models contained in ICSD (the redundant models with the same structures are 
ignored) and their corresponding standard distorted models are provided here, and are sufficient to 
support for our verification on the construction relation between the CSCPC and the EDs and IDs. 
If more structural models mentioned in our work need to be provided for review, please contact us.
